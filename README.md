# CerebroApp website

The old cerebroapp website has been migrated to nextjs.
Now we have:

- [x] Updated download links (no need to rebuild the site to get updated ones)
- [x] Buttons show the latest version of the package that has been published (they may differ if a package is not published for a platform)

- [x] Removed old links

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then you can start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
